# Agent Swarm Framework

A powerful bash-based agent swarm system that generates complete software applications via coordinated AI agents. The system analyzes specifications and autonomously plans, designs, implements, tests, and documents applications through specialized agents.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Specialized agents (architect, developer, tester, documenter) work together
- **Intelligent Task Planning** - Automatically breaks down specifications into executable tasks with dependencies
- **Complete Code Generation** - Produces working, deployable applications
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Tracks all agent activities with inputs/outputs for full transparency
- **Flexible Architecture** - Easy to extend with new agent types and capabilities
- **Production Ready** - Generates Docker configurations, tests, and deployment guides

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Bash 4.0+** (macOS/Linux)
- **jq** - JSON processor for parsing configurations
- **chmod** - For setting executable permissions

### Install Prerequisites

**On macOS:**
```bash
# Install Homebrew if not installed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install jq
brew install jq
```

**On Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jq
```

**On CentOS/RHEL:**
```bash
sudo yum install jq
```

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Agent Swarm Framework

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir my-agent-swarm
cd my-agent-swarm

# Download the framework files (or git clone if available)
# You'll need these files:
# - swarm.sh (main orchestration script)
# - lib/ (task planner, agent executor, logger)
# - agents/ (specialized agent scripts)
```

### 2. Set Up Directory Structure

```bash
# Create the framework structure
mkdir -p {lib,agents,logs,workspace}

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x swarm.sh
chmod +x agents/*.sh
```

The framework structure should look like:
```
agent-swarm/
├── swarm.sh                 # Main orchestration script
├── lib/
│   ├── task_planner.sh      # Specification analysis & task breakdown
│   ├── agent_executor.sh    # Agent coordination & execution
│   └── logger.sh            # Comprehensive activity logging
├── agents/
│   ├── architect.sh         # System architecture & design
│   ├── developer.sh         # Code implementation
│   ├── tester.sh           # Test creation & validation
│   └── documenter.sh       # Documentation generation
├── logs/                   # Generated activity logs
└── workspace/              # Generated projects and artifacts
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Test the framework
./swarm.sh
```

You should see the usage message:
```
Usage: ./swarm.sh <agents_config> <specification_file>

Arguments:
  agents_config      - JSON file defining available agents and their roles
  specification_file - Text file describing the target application
```

## 📖 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create Agent Configuration

Create `agents.json` with agent definitions:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "architect": {
      "name": "System Architect",
      "description": "Designs system architecture and makes technical decisions",
      "capabilities": [
        "System design",
        "Technology stack selection", 
        "Database schema design",
        "API specification",
        "Architecture documentation"
      ]
    },
    "developer": {
      "name": "Software Developer",
      "description": "Implements code based on architectural specifications", 
      "capabilities": [
        "Code implementation",
        "Database integration",
        "API development",
        "Frontend development",
        "Code optimization"
      ]
    },
    "tester": {
      "name": "Quality Assurance Tester",
      "description": "Creates and executes tests to ensure code quality",
      "capabilities": [
        "Unit test creation",
        "Integration testing", 
        "End-to-end testing",
        "Performance testing",
        "Test automation"
      ]
    },
    "documenter": {
      "name": "Technical Documenter", 
      "description": "Creates comprehensive documentation for the software",
      "capabilities": [
        "Technical documentation",
        "User guides",
        "API documentation", 
        "Deployment guides",
        "Code comments"
      ]
    }
  },
  "execution_settings": {
    "max_parallel_agents": 3,
    "task_timeout": "30m",
    "retry_failed_tasks": true,
    "max_retries": 2,
    "log_level": "info"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Write Application Specification

Create `my_app_spec.txt` describing your desired application:

```
APPLICATION SPECIFICATION

PURPOSE:
Create a [describe your application - e.g., "blog management system", "inventory tracker", "event scheduler"]

FEATURES:
- [List key features]

Watch the real-time output showing:
- Specification analysis (2,000+ character specs processed)
- Task breakdown into phases (Architecture → Implementation → Testing → Documentation)
- Agent execution with live status updates
- Task completion tracking

Example output:
```

```

### Step 5: Review Generated Application

Check the generated project:
```bash
# Navigate to generated project
cd workspace/artifacts/project

# View project structure
ls -la

# Backend (Node.js/Express)
cd backend
cat package.json
ls src/

# Frontend (React/TypeScript)

# ... implementation
EOF

chmod +x agents/designer.sh
```

Add to `agents.json`:
```json
{
  "agents": {

## 📊 Understanding the Output

### Generated Project Structure

Every application follows this pattern:
```

```

### Logging and Tracking

Monitor agent activities in the `logs/` directory:
```bash
# View main execution log
tail -f logs/swarm_*_main.log

# Monitor agent activities
tail -f logs/swarm_*_agents.log

# Track task completion
tail -f logs/swarm_*_tasks.log
```

### Task Execution Flow

The system follows this workflow:
1. **Analysis Phase** - Parse specification and extract requirements
2. **Planning Phase** - Break down into 15 coordinated tasks
3. **Architecture Phase** - Design system architecture and data models
4. **Implementation Phase** - Generate working code for backend and frontend
5. **Testing Phase** - Create comprehensive test suites
6. **Documentation Phase** - Generate user guides and technical docs

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied:**
```bash
chmod +x swarm.sh agents/*.sh
```

**jq Command Not Found:**
```bash
# macOS
brew install jq

# Ubuntu
sudo apt install jq
```

**Task Failures:**
Check the logs for specific error messages:
```bash
cat logs/swarm_*_main.log | grep ERROR
```

**Empty Output:**
Verify your specification file has sufficient detail (recommended 1000+ characters).

### Debug Mode

Run with verbose logging:
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
./swarm.sh agents.json my_spec.txt
```
