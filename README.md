## ‚ö° Parallel vs Sequential Execution

### Sequential Execution (`swarm.sh`)

**How it works:**
- Agents execute one task at a time
- Tasks processed in dependency order
- Single main process handles all execution
- Simpler logging and debugging

**Advantages:**
- Lower resource usage
- Easier to debug and monitor
- More predictable execution order
- Better for development and testing

**Use when:**
- Working on smaller applications
- Debugging agent behavior
- Limited system resources
- Learning the framework

### Parallel Execution (`swarm_parallel.sh`)

**How it works:**
- Multiple agents run simultaneously in background processes
- Up to 3 agents execute concurrently (configurable)
- Automatic dependency resolution prevents conflicts
- Real-time progress monitoring

**Advantages:**
- Up to 3x faster execution time
- Better resource utilization
- Efficient for large projects
- Production-ready performance

**Technical Details:**
```bash
# Each agent runs in its own background process
architect_12345 &    # PID 12345
developer_12346 &    # PID 12346  
tester_12347 &       # PID 12347

# Main process coordinates and monitors
# Dependencies automatically enforced
# Results collected asynchronously
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "execution_settings": {
    "max_parallel_agents": 3,     // Max concurrent agents
    "task_timeout": "30m",        // Per-task timeout
    "retry_failed_tasks": true,   // Auto-retry on failure
    "max_retries": 2             // Retry limit
  }
}
```

**Use when:**
- Building complex applications
- Production deployments
- Time is critical
- System has sufficient resources

### Performance Comparison

**Example: Task Management App (15 tasks)**

| Mode | Execution Time | Resource Usage | Process Count |
|------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| Sequential | ~45 seconds | 1 CPU core | 1 main process |
| Parallel | ~15 seconds | 3+ CPU cores | 1 main + 3 background |

**Task Dependencies Handled Automatically:**
```
Sequential:  arch_001 ‚Üí arch_002 ‚Üí arch_003 ‚Üí impl_001 ‚Üí ...
            
Parallel:    arch_001 (agent1)
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arch_002 (agent2) [waits for arch_001]  
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ arch_003 (agent3) [waits for arch_002]
             ‚Üì
            impl_001, impl_002, impl_003 (parallel when ready)
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Agent Types

Create new specialized agents by adding scripts to the `agents/` directory:

```bash
# Create custom agent
cat > agents/designer.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Designer Agent - Creates UI/UX designs and wireframes

TASK_CONTEXT_FILE="$1"
# ... implementation
EOF

chmod +x agents/designer.sh
```

Add to `agents.json`:
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "designer": {
      "name": "UI/UX Designer",
      "description": "Creates user interface designs and wireframes",
      "capabilities": ["Wireframe creation", "UI design", "UX optimization"]
